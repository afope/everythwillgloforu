i thought kisses were how lovers greeted
how they said bye bye and said hello
my toes curled up at the sight of my lover
i'd been gone a while
and without a kiss to welcome me
i concluded we were business partners
business partners say hello without kisses
lovers don't

  but why didn't i kiss him
  does love wax cold as years go by?
  what is time in the grand scheme of loving?
  time is ineffective where love grow(l)s
  and if love grows where the thing that nourishes it is also love
  then i should've kissed him.
  a friendly thank you for being with my madness kind of kiss.
